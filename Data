I will use two sources of data:

For areas, I use list of areas from Wikipedia. Here is, for example, London:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_areas_of_London
It contains all areas with links to GeoHack service. Actually I donâ€™t need the service. Instead I use the link itself to extract longitude and latitude from the URL.

For the list of restorants, I will use Foursquare.
Then I will create a list of all ethnic restorants types and filter venues of those types.
Finally, I will have a variable, where I can set the type of resorant I'm going to open.
