Project title: Find areas for an ethnic cousine

If somebody is going to open a restorant with ethnic cousine, they should look for a location in areas, where many ethnic restorants exist (which means that there is enough demand), but no restorant of the cousine they are going to open.
For example, I'm looking for a place for a new thai restorant. If I open it in area, where two other thai restorants exist, I risk to meet strong competition. If I open it on the city suburbs without other thai restorants nearby, my risk is low demand for such restorant. However, if I open it in a neighborhood with several chineese, indian etc. restorants, but no thai restorant, the chance of success will be higher.

Therefore, my application will create a map of a city and mark all areas with more then N etnic restorants and no restorant of selected ethnic cousine.
